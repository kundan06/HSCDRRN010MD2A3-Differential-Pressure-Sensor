# HSCDRRN010MD2A3-Differential-Pressure-Sensor
TruStability HSC and SSC pressure sensor library for the Arduino.

  This library implements the following features:

   - read raw pressure count values
   - compute absolute pressure 
   Honeywell High Accuracy Ceramic (HSC) and Standard Accuracy Ceramic 
  (SSC) Series are piezoresistive silicon pressure sensors.
